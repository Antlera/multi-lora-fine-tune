# ASPEN: Efficient Multi-LoRA Fine Tuning with Shared-Based Model
[![Python application](https://github.com/TUDB-Labs/multi-lora-fine-tune/actions/workflows/python-app.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/TUDB-Labs/multi-lora-fine-tune/actions/workflows/python-app.yml)

This repository provides tools for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) using the LoRA or QLoRA methods more efficiently. It provides the framework to support multiple LoRA/qLoRA models fine tunning at the same time. By reusing the shared frozen-based model, we provide the framework to reduce GPU Memory usage for multiple fine-tuning models.

## Overview

## Installation
```bash
# Optional but recommended
conda create -n aspen_env python=3.8
conda activate aspen_env
# Install requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
After installation, you can use ASPEN directly in your code:
```python
import aspen
```
## Quickstart

The `mlora.py` code is a starting point for finetuning on various datasets.
Basic command for finetuning a baseline model on the Alpaca dataset:
```bash
python mlora.py \
  --base_model decapoda-research/llama-7b-hf \
  --config ./config/alpaca.json \
  --load_8bit true
```

You can check the template finetune configuration in [template](./template/) folder.

For further detailed usage information, please use `--help` option:
```bash
python mlora.py --help
```
